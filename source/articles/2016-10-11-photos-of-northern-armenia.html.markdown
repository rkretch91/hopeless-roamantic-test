The border crossing from Georgia to Armenia was the smoothest and quickest I had ever come across and anti-climatically there I was in a totally new country for the day. I have always found this concept mind-blowing; how a border separates two entirely different cultures, languages, and lifes, but within a matter of minutes you can go from one to the other. These moments are the closest I get to 'being in two places at once'.

The northern part of Armenia is filled with churches, monasteries, history, and a fair-share of soviet nostalgia. Sure the churches can become repetitive after seeing two or three, but the history is impressive and witnessing people who devote themselves solely to maintaining these isolated monasteries is eye-opening. It is worth the day trip from Tbilisi or Yerevan to check out this nature-filled and historic north.
