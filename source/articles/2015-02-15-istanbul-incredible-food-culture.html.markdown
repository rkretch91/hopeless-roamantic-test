I am going to get right into it and say that Istanbul is the world’s mecca of FOOD. I am one of the biggest foodies that I know, but I have never quite experienced anything like Istanbul before. For all of those who do not travel frequently, the best foods in the world are currently invisible and outside of what you may consider real as far as food tastes and varieties.

A few other traveling foodies have told me that Istanbul’s food is mediocre at best. Those people must have succumbed too often to the millions of donor kebab stands around the city with massive rotating cylinders of meat. Not knowing a lick of Turkish, it is certainly easier just to point at the meat and say “Doner please” fully knowing what you are going to get. But if you come to Istanbul to just eat doner, you are missing out, and subjecting yourself to a heavy risk of diarrhea.

I was lucky enough to have just about the best [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) experience I could imagine. Ösgür, a hard-working hedonist, took me in and gave me one piece of advice after rejecting my hopes to seeing things like the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia, “don’t come to Istanbul for the historical shit, this is the place to eat.” Those words struck me hard, and I immediately trusted this stranger’s words. I made it a mission to try and convert my muscle to fat in the next few days by just focusing my attention on eating.

So let’s start in no particular order. I might throw a story in here and there as to how I was introduced to the dish, but on with the gluttony:

One night after a few beers and a long day of walking in the rain, hunger overcame me. Ösgür came to the rescue and ordered us delivery. While we waited, he described the sandwich to me as a sort of bologna and cheese sandwich. I was a little apprehensive about that description until it actually came. The name of glorious explosion of a sandwich is <b>Izmir Kumru</b>, featuring a crisp but creamy cheese called <b>sucuk</b> dripping through the gaps of mountains of salami/bologna/pepperoni-like meat. The perfectly baked bread, meat, and cheese hit every taste bud and induce an unavoidable mouth orgasm. I ate this twice in my five days in Istanbul.

While just the sandwich would have left me satiated for days, Osgur insisted on raising the bar and ordering dessert. This time, <b>waffles were on the menu</b>. Typically sold at a stand, the waffles are the soft base to a multitude of fillings ranging from chocolate sauce to kiwi to nuts to whatever you can imagine. The waffle wraps around the fillings like a taco. Eating ¾ of this sent me into a sugar-induced food coma. Luckily, I still had a quarter of this baby left in the morning (eaten from bed) to start off my next day of indulgence.

My ultimate night of indulgence began after a long run along the bosphorus. Dessert came first, or was it dinner? It is hard to tell with <b>Künefe</b>, which resembles and tastes like a sweet dessert, but has a slightly salty, gooey, cheesy filling. The sweet syrup hits your taste buds first along with the wiry texture of the outer pastry. As you begin to chew, the slightly salty taste and gooey texture follows soon after. A sensory explosion!

After a little break, and a few drinks, and a few more drinks, and some cool old-Turkey rooftop bars, and then falling asleep at bars, it was time to eat again. My body at this point was addicted to Turkish food. First course, <b>street muscles</b>. All over the streets, are stands with a large pot of standing muscles over ice. When you go up to the vendor, they immediately begin handing you muscles which they open for you. The muscles are stuffed with well…muscles and a seasoned rice. You just tip your head back and let the scrumptious combination fall into your mouth. Before you know it, you’ve had about 20-30 muscles and have racked up a bill. But it’s all worth it for these little guys. Second course, <b>Kokorec</b>, or as my roommate calls it, “sheep intesticle sandwiches (really just intestines, not testicles)”. Sounds unappealing? Being used to eating all kinds of organs in China, and knowing the deliciousness of intestines, my mouth started to water. The intestine is seasoned with lemon, olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper and sandwiched between two thick pieces of bread. 

With the hangover in full force, I sluggishly met up with a friend and eagerly requested a full-fat, delicious meal to soak up all of the pain from a night of binge drinking and eating. Without hesitation, I was led into a restaurant specializing in <b>Manti</b>. By this point, I thought I had tasted it all in Turkey, but that was far from the truth. A few minutes later, a plate of what looked like small gnocchis with a thick, white, aromatic sauce and a bit of red oil stared back at my glazed over, transfixed eyes. I went for the spoon, and put a overflowing portion of the mini gnocchi and sauce into it, and brought it to my mouth. My tastebuds went ecstatic at the initial sourness of the yogurt, followed by the salty spiciness of the oil. Then, my teeth sunk into the gnocchi which was secretly stuffed with minced lamb. I devoured the plate and a minor bout of depression overcame me as I longed for more. Turkey just has its way with striking every one of your taste bud categories in one mouthful. 

And I'll end you with the love of my life, a true food soulmate, called <b>Baklava</b>. You all have heard or tasted it, but many haven't had the chance to try it in its motherland. My final day was spent heading to [Karaköy Güllüoglu](https://www.karakoygulluoglu.com/baklavas), the world renowned baklava shop, absolutely filled to the brim with locals and tourists. In this shop, human generosity goes out the window as the mind is clouded by the aromatic buttery smell of phyllo pastry, honey, and roasted nuts. A sort of greed and unsatiable desire capitalizes the mind until one gets his or her portion. My friend and I chose a variety of baklava, the most unique being chocolate, and got it boxed up with a generous portion of homemade clotted cream on top. We made our way to the Karaköy docks and devoured this delacacy with Turkish tea as we crossed the mighty Bosphorus and watched the sun set over the distant Blue Mosque.

My time in Istanbul was not spent checking out the innards of the Blue Mosque, but was well spent learning about a cuisine that has shaped many other cuisines. Turkey is a country full of culinary geniuses and has since inspired my passion for making the world's most perfect baklava. So avoid the doner and take this blogpost with you as reference on your next trip to Turkey.
